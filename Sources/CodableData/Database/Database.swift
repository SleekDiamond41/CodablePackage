/// A type-safe wrapper around the SQLite3 database framework.

/// - Note: A `Database` is not thread-safe, and its methods should only be called from a single thread. It is advised that consumers of this framework create a wrapper around a `Database` instance rather than consuming it directly. The wrapper should guarantee that the `Database` methods are accessed on a single thread. Note that this does not mean one thread at a time, it means one thread ever, as long as the `Database` instance exists. Failure to do so could cause unexpected behavior.
